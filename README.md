# Arduino-GP2Y0A21YK-library
Library for the Sharp GP2Y0A41SK IR Distance sensor.

This library uses a lookup table in program memory to convert the ADC values to distance values.
This library was a test to evaluate code size and processing time.

An alternative library, where the board does the actual calculation on the CPU can be found [here](https://github.com/jeroendoggen/Arduino-distance-sensor-library)
